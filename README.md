# Breast Cancer Prediction Model 

## 📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign or malignant** based on medical features. The model is deployed as an API using **FastAPI** and **Render**.

## 🔍 Features
✅ Binary classification using `RandomForestClassifier`  
✅ API built with `FastAPI`  
✅ Scalable deployment on `Render`  
✅ Easy-to-use prediction endpoint  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is from `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`, containing 30 medical features.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python, Scikit-Learn** (ML Model)  
- **FastAPI** (API Development)  
- **Render** (Deployment)  

## 🚀 How to Use
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
